QtSimTemplate
=====================================
A template designed to make it very easy to render a simulation in real time using Qt.

Qt demands that it be run as the primary environment, making it sometimes complicated to let it interface with previously written simulation code. This template sets up a simulation object as a separate thread that can emit a relatively thread-safe render call.

This code is based on the AnalogWindow and RasterWindow classes from the Qt5 example code.


Usage
=====================================
Qt should be called with qmake. Check to make sure that your qmake calls Qt5's qmake on your system.
